# WarpDiff

A/B comparison tool for images, video, and audio. Hosted on GitHub Pages.

- **Repo**: https://github.com/jayriddle/warpdiff
- **Architecture**: Single-file app — everything lives in `index.html` (~6500 lines of HTML, CSS, and JS)

## Key Technical Patterns

- Frame stepping uses midpoint seeking `(frame+0.5)/fps` to avoid IEEE 754 boundary issues
- Timecode display uses `Math.floor(time * fps + 0.01)` epsilon to match frame numbers
- `_frameStepping` flag pattern for suppressing play/pause sync handlers during programmatic seeks
- Equal-area layout for mixed orientations: `A = min((availW/Σ√ri)², availH²·min(ri))`
- Scope rendering uses Uint16Array hit counts + putImageData for performance
- Audio viz uses `decodeAudioData()` → waveform/spectrogram computation, drawn to canvas
- Loading overlay (`#loadingOverlay`) shows status during audio decode; hidden at `startFadeIn()`

## Naming Conventions

- UI shows two view modes: **Overlay** and **Grid** (never "3-UP")
- Grid sub-layouts (3 files): **Inline** (equal cols/rows) and **Offset** (L-shaped 1+2)
- Internal code still uses `tripartite`, `tripartiteLayout3Col`, etc. — only user-facing text was renamed
- Slots are named `original`, `editA`, `editB` internally; UI shows "GT" (Ground Truth), "A", "B"

## Coding Conventions

- No build step, no dependencies — vanilla HTML/CSS/JS only
- Prefer editing `index.html` over creating new files
- CSS is in a single `<style>` block at the top; JS is in a single `<script>` block
- Use `_prefixed` names for module-level private state (e.g., `_frameStepping`, `_audioSlotVizData`)
- Debounced layout functions use the pattern `functionNameDebounced` wrapping `functionName`

## Testing

- Framework: Playwright (Chromium only)
- Run: `npx playwright test`
- Config: `playwright.config.ts` — serves app on port 3948 via `npx serve`
- Tests use `window.__testAPI` to read internal state (exposed in `index.html`)
- Fixtures are generated PNGs created at test time in `tests/fixtures/`

## Architecture Document

Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for the full picture — it covers:
- State model and all subsystems
- Current workflow pain points (manual download → slot misassignment)
- Chrome extension that bridges the review tool today (saves ~10s/task but Chrome-only, no metadata)
- Three integration paths (URL params → JSON manifest → iframe postMessage)
- Prioritized improvement plan (6 items, none started yet)
- Known structural limitations and what to preserve

## Current Status

The improvement plan in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` has **no items started**. The codebase is at feature-complete v3 for standalone use. Next steps are about integration with the server-based review tool:

1. **Dynamic slot model** — replace fixed `{ original, editA, editB }` with an array (prerequisite for everything else)
2. **Reference strip + prompt panel** — two-zone layout for showing references alongside outputs
3. **Manifest loading + URL params** — eliminate the download-and-drop workflow
4. **Sync coordinator** — formalize the ad-hoc sync lock pattern
5. **Reactive state store** — only if complexity warrants it
6. **Lazy reference loading** — only when reference strip exists
